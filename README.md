# iocc-death-star

This is an obfuscated C, triangle renderer. It renders a scene from Star Wars and spits out a tga image.

I had the idea to try obfuscated C after learning about [iocc](http://ioccc.org). If I remember correctly,
my program is pretty close to the specifications, but I never finished or submitted it.

My inspiration for triangle rendering came from the game [Another World](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Another_World_(video_game))

**Output**

I started by taking an image from the movie, and then drawing each triangle in photoshop. I kept track of the triangle coordinates and used those in my program.

My obfuscation idea was centered around overloading all the symbols, using separate namespaces for structs, enums, etc.

For example:
```
enum hello { };
int hello;
```
