# iocc-death-star

This is an obfuscated C, triangle renderer. It renders a scene from Star Wars and spits out a tga image.

**Output**

I started by taking an image from the movie, and then drawing each triangle in photoshop. I kept track of the triangle coordinates and used those in my program.

My obfuscation idea was centered around overloading all the symbols, using separate namespaces for structs, enums, etc.

I had the idea after learning about [iocc](http://ioccc.org). If I remember correctly,
my program is pretty close to the specifications, but I never finished or submitted it.
